> #B. Applying Bayes' Theorem 
> #Jane is getting married tomorrow, at an outdoor ceremony in the desert. In recent years, it has rained only 5 days each year. Unfortunately, the weatherman has predicted rain for tomorrow. When it actually rains, the weatherman correctly forecasts rain 90% of the time. When it doesn't rain, he incorrectly forecasts rain 10% of the time.
> 
> #What is the probability that it will rain on the day of Jane's wedding? 
> 
> #Solution: The sample space is defined by two mutually-exclusive events - it rains or it does not rain. Additionally, a third event occurs when the weatherman predicts rain. Notation for these events appears below.
> 
> #Event A1. It rains on Jane's wedding.
> #Event A2. It does not rain on Marie's wedding.
> #Event B. The weatherman predicts rain.
> 
> #In terms of probabilities, we know the following:
> #P( A1 ) = 5/365 =0.0136985 [It rains 5 days out of the year.]
> #P( A2 ) = 360/365 = 0.9863014 [It does not rain 360 days out of the year.]
> #P( B | A1 ) = 0.9 [When it rains, the weatherman predicts rain 90% of the time.]
> #P( B | A2 ) = 0.1 [When it does not rain, the weatherman predicts rain 10% of the time.]
> #We want to know P( A1 | B ), the probability it will rain on the day of Marie's wedding, given a forecast for rain by the weatherman. The answer can be determined from Bayes' theorem, as shown below.
> 
> #P( A1 | B ) = P( A1 ) P( B | A1 )
> #P( A1 ) P( B | A1 ) + P( A2 ) P( B | A2 )
> #P( A1 | B ) = (0.014)(0.9) / [ (0.014)(0.9) + (0.986)(0.1) ]
> #P( A1 | B ) = 0.111
> #Note the somewhat unintuitive result. Even when the weatherman predicts rain, it only rains only about 11% of the time. Despite the weatherman's gloomy prediction, there is a good chance that Marie will not get rained on at her wedding.
> #B1. Is this answer True or False.
> 
> #The answer is true.
> 
> #B2. Please explain why?
> #This is the formuala given: P(A1|B)=P(A1)*P(B|A1)/[P(A1)*P(B|A1)+P(A2)*P(B|A2)]
> #The numerator would be the probability of it rainining and the weatherman predicting rain, when it rains: P(A1)*P(B|A1)
> #The denominator woudl be to total probability of the weatherman predicting rain: [P(A1)*P(B|A1)+P(A2)*P(B|A2)]
> #Plug it in and we get only an 11.11% chance!
> (5/365)*(0.9)/((5/365)*(0.9)+(360/365)*(0.1))
