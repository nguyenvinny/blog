> #Question 1:
> #The director of manufacturing at a cookies company needs to determine whether a new machine is able to produce a particular type of cookies according to the manufacturer's specifications, which indicate that cookies should have a mean of 70 and standard deviation of 3.5 pounds. A sample of 49 cookies reveals a sample mean breaking strength of 69.1 pounds.
> 
> #A. State the null and alternative hypothesis _______
> # Null Hypothesis: New machine is able to produce cookies to specifications for average strength.
> # Alternative Hypothesis: New machine is not able to produce cookies to specifications for average strength.
> 
> #B. Is there evidence that the machine is not meeting the manufacturer's specifications for average strength? Use a 0.05 level of significance _______

> alpha > p
[1] FALSE
> #This means that there is weak evidence to conclude that the Alternative Hypothesis is true. Thus we reject the Alternative Hypothesis and accept the Null Hypothesis.

> #The correlation coefficient analysis formula:
> #  (r) =[ nΣxy – (Σx)(Σy) / Sqrt([nΣx2 – (Σx)2][nΣy2 – (Σy)2])]
> 
> #r: The correlation coefficient is denoted by the letter r.
> #n: Number of values. If we had five people we were calculating the correlation coefficient for, the value of n would be 5.

> #y: This is the second data variable.
> #Σ: The Sigma symbol (Greek) tells us to calculate the “sum of” whatever is tagged next to it.
