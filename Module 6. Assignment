> #Question A.
> #Consider a population consisting of the following values, which represents the number of ice cream purchases during the academic year for each of the five housemates.
> n <- c(8, 14, 16, 10, 11)
> 
> #a. Compute the mean of this population.
> mean(n)
[1] 11.8
> 
> #b. Select a random sample of size 2 out of the five members. See the example I used in my Power-point presentation slide # 13.
> s <- sample(n,2)
> s
[1] 11 16
> 
> #c. Compute the mean and standard deviation of your sample.
> mean(s)
[1] 13.5
> sd(s)
[1] 3.535534
> 
> #d. Compare the Mean and Standard deviation of your sample to the entire population of this set (8,14, 16, 10, 11).
> mean(n)
[1] 11.8
> sd(n)
[1] 3.193744
> #The poplulation mean and the standard deviation compared to the sample is fairly close, being a difference of roughly 1.

> 
> #Question B.
> #Suppose that the sample size n = 100 and the population proportion p = 0.95.
> 
> #1. Does the sample proportion p have approximately a normal distribution? Explain.
> n = 100
> p = 0.95
> q = (1 - p)
> #Since p = .95, q = .05. 
> #p * n = .95 * 100 = 95
> #q * n = .05 * 100 = 5
> #The distribution is expected to be normal if both np and nq are greater than 5. 
> #Np is greater than 5, but nq is not greater than 5. Thus sample proportion does not have approximately a normal distribution.
> 
> #2.What is the smallest value of n for which the sampling distribution of p is approximately normal?
> #q * n = .05 * 101 = 5.05
> #The smallest value of n for the sample distribution to be normal is 101. 
> 
> #------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> 
> #Question C.
> #Simulated coin tossing is probability better done using function called rbinom than using function called sample.  Explain.
> 
> #It is better to use the function 'rbinom' (random binomial function) because what is returned are randomly selected values from an infinite population. Using the function 'sample' would only pull from a finite population. Thus it is more accurate for "random sampling".
