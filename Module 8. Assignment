> #A researcher is interested in the effects of drug against stress reaction. She gives a reaction time test to three different groups of subjects: one group that is under a great deal of stress, one group under a moderate amount of stress, and a third group that is under almost no stress. The subjects of the study were instructed to take the drug test during their next stress episode and to report their stress on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being most pain).
